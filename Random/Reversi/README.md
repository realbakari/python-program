The code defines several functions that together implement the game of Reversi. Here is a brief explanation of each of the functions:

drawBoard(board): This function takes in a board and prints it to the screen. It prints the column and row numbers along the top and left side of the board, and uses + and | characters to draw the grid. It also uses X and O characters to represent the tiles on the board.

resetBoard(board): This function takes in a board and sets it to its starting position. It does this by looping over each square on the board and setting it to an empty space (represented by a space character), except for the four center squares, which are set to X and O in the starting configuration.

getNewBoard(): This function creates a new, empty 8x8 board and returns it. It does this by creating a 2D list with 8 rows and 8 columns, and filling each square with a space character.

isValidMove(board, tile, xstart, ystart): This function checks if a move is valid on the given board. It does this by checking if the square at the given coordinates is empty and on the board, and if the move would result in any of the opponent's tiles being "captured" (flipped over to the player's color). If the move is valid, it returns a list of coordinates of the tiles that would be captured. If the move is not valid, it returns False.

isOnBoard(x, y): This function checks if the given coordinates are located on the board. It returns True if the coordinates are between 0 and 7 (the board is 8x8), and False otherwise.

getBoardWithValidMoves(board, tile): This function takes in a board and a player's tile color, and returns a new board with a . character in each square where the player can make a valid move.

getValidMoves(board, tile): This function takes in a board and a player's tile color, and returns a list of coordinates where the player can make a valid move.

makeMove(board, tile, xstart, ystart): This function allows a player to make a move on the given board. It first checks if the move is valid, and if it is, it places the player's tile on the board and captures any of the opponent's tiles that are surrounded by the player's tiles. If the move is not valid, it raises an error.

The code also includes a section that allows the game to be played. It creates a new board, and alternates between the two players, allowing each player to enter the coordinates of the square they want to place their tile on. The game ends when one player cannot make any more moves, and the player with the most tiles on the board wins.
