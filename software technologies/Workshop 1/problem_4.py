# Write Python code that reads two integers from the keyboard. If the first
# integer is in the range 1. . 100 and the first integer is less than the second integer OR if
# the first integer is at least twice the second integer and the second integer is not in the
# range -8..16 (with the exception it can be zero) print True. Otherwise print False. You
# must NOT use the Python if or if-else statement. All ranges are inclusive.
